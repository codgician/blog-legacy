Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius. I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain, can hardly hurt me now
You're here. That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers grow

The rain can't hurt me now
This rain will wash away what's past
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
Iâ€™ll sleep in your embrace at last

The rain that brings you here is heaven blessed
The skies begin to clear, and I'm at rest
A breath away from where you are
I've come home from so far

- "A Little Fall of Rain" of Les Miz
